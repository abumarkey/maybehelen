## About us

### Helena Fronc 

I’ve been an English teacher for over 20 years. I graduated from Opole University with Master’s Degree in English Studies and have since had the experience working in public and private schools, as well as language institutes in Poland and more or less exotic places across the world.

My work in diverse environment, with students of diverse nationalities, with different skill levels is a school of life which have let me work out effective teaching methods, as well as develop the ability to accommodate student’s needs.

I’m offering a wide variety of lessons. I work with children, teenagers and adults; students in their first steps learning English, as well as advanced students preparing for IB or IELTS.

I’ve had the pleasure working with students who use English professionally every day, who need to advance their language qualifications or use Business English fluently in speaking and writing.

### Marek Fronc 

I've been teaching General and Business English for over two years. I also help students prepare for IELTS and CAE. I sat IELTS myself and scored 7.5 _overall_. I've taught in a diversity of environments: in Bahrain, and in Poland. My students include immigrants, American university candidates and professionals of many fields: from HR to government ministries to Customs. 

Foreign languages are a huge part of my life. I've kept in teach with native speakers from four corners of the world since I lived in Bahrain. All that means I help students communicate better in a variety of contexts and cultures. 

It goes beyond that! I've learn Czech, German, Arabic, and have been learning Swedish as well. This allows me to see how a lesson should look like - because I can see what works on myself.
